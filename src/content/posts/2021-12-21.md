# Sign Language

on a flight between  
sun and winter,  
i watched sign language  
up a couple rows,  
a pair spilling  
toward each other—  
aisle seats—  
her calming him,  
him not one to fly,  
her sign language voice  
i gained an eye for.  
  
in a gallery, too  
two people threw  
signals back and  
forth, a painting  
here, a brushstroke  
there, not jasper  
johns but faster  
motions, larger  
gestures, ardor in  
art, as i  
mumbled to myself,  
i unfold my inner  
voice and tell it  
to move its hands.  
  
fingers  
fold and fly  
like paper cranes,  
with each crease,  
i wonder the signs:  
what's a scream,  
what's a desire,  
what's a scolding,  
what's a tangent,  
a more-hands sandwich,  
what's a song  
without an ear, just  
joint-bending stanzas?  
  
"watch."  
that's what all  
the signs mean  
to me.  
  
i know not  
a deaf one's  
ear, only that  
those who hear  
near those who  
speak are not  
always such perfect  
pairs, but you and i  
just might be,  
because i am one  
who does not hear  
and you are one  
who does not speak,  
wish  
you voiced   
your thoughts  
wish  
you spoke  
my language  
wish   
you laid  
here, so we  
could translate  
with a thumb-clasped  
embrace,  
wish  
i could have  
my hands on you  
to tell you sorry  
for not listening  
to tell you i love you  
for all you say,  
and a final  
hand-speak act,  
i'd cup my hands  
around my ears  
and have them  
listen:  
  
to that  
silence,  
those  
hands,  
sounding-off  
you.
