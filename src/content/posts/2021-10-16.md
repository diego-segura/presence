bronzed reflections on a young woman  
looking at herself in the  
side view mirror of a pickup truck,  
bumpy ride on a back road to heaven,  
eager not to take the road back to hell  
tomorrow morning.

his light wash blue jeans  
and hands with strong lines  
rub back and forth on her denim,  
her hands on his,  
fingernails deep in each other's backs,  
hands under hair and underwear  

blue jeans   
are for  
hard labor:  

gold panning  
silver smithing  
copper mining  
steel forging.  

throwing a gem at the gravel  
to see just how, or if,  
she will shatter,  
a million sharp pieces  
go flying, glimmering in texas sun,  
ricochet and chip the paint  
on his pickup truck, a new  
hole in the knee of his blue jeans  
while he crawls like cinderella  
to collect the debris  
as if there's a way to repair  
what took millennia for  
god, a female god, to forge.
