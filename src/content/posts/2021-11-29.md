# Turn the Map Sideways

michigan's mitt  
looks more like a mutt,

louisiana resembles  
a ruger handgun,

alabama looks like  
a fatter oklahoma  
if it could get fatter,  

illinois doesn't look like  
illinois,  
it looks like baseboards,  
fancy ones.

freedom is:  
travel anywhere on the map, 

power is:  
circle a part of the map  
and call it yours,

perspective is:  
see the map without borders.
