which of her two eyes  
do i like most? 

one is brown, the other  
a grey-green.

how we met, i know.  
but  
how we loved, i do not know.

she fucks rich men  
and model girls  
and she is here with me —   
the duality of vision,  
one of her two-colored eyes  
must take pity on me.

i act like i'm surprised  
but her god complex is  
a mirror of my own.

will she be mad if  
i tell her i love her  
one more time?  

i use my right hand  
to hold her neck  
and i kiss her on the left,  
peering at the brown eye,  
the eyelid mostly shut.  

great sex  
makes you think,  
love  
makes you wonder.  

lucky for me:  
my brain is firm  
in these sheets,  
not skyscapes.  

lucky, too:

would she — “want to  
go again?” — “yes,”  
she would.
